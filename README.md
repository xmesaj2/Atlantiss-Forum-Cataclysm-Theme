# Atlantiss-Forum-Cataclysm-Theme
Catalcysm style for Atlantiss.eu forums

I made a quick recolor of forums css, you can use it with Stylish addon for web browser. Not everything is covered, some things might need directly modifying theme in board style instead just css like user names, images etc. 

[Stylish for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/?src=external-userstyleshome), [Stylish for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe), [Stylish for Safari](http://sobolev.us/stylish/), or [Stylish for Opera](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/stylish/)
 
Work on hold, report critical issues & suggestions in [this thread[(http://community.atlantiss.eu/index.php?/topic/7461-forum07-jan-2016-cataclysm-theme-css-rev2), so I can fix when I find some time.
